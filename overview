In today's digital world, managing files and folders efficiently on mobile devices is essential. 
Smartphones and tablets often store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, documents, and apps. However, navigating and managing these files can be cumbersome without an intuitive and feature-rich tool. 
Many existing file manager apps are either too simplistic, lack advanced features, or include ads and unnecessary permissions that compromise user privacy. 
Users need a reliable, fast, and privacy-respecting app that allows them to manage their files, compress media, secure data with password protection, and access storage analysis. 
This project seeks to develop a Simple File Manager for Android devices to address these issues by providing a straightforward and professional solution. 
This file manager will streamline daily file operations, improve user productivity, and maintain high standards of privacy and security.
